### NixSpam-IP-Dump
40.000 ip’s
This publicly available DNS blacklist is permanently regenerated by the NiX Spam project of the German IT magazine iX. It contains IP addresses of spam senders and hash values (fuzzy checksums) of incoming spam. The blacklist can be used to protect mailservers against spam. But checking a single DNSBL should not be the only criterion for spam.

This list is pulled into the ipset/ firewall through a local script:
